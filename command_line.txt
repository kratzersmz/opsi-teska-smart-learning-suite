Below are The following are examples of installation scenarios and their accompanying command lines for use in to use to deploying SMART Education Software.

NOTES: 

The Support folder and its subfolders must be in the same folder as the SMARTLearningSuite.msi package so that it has access to the supporting handwriting resources.

You must open the Command Prompt "As Administrator" to successfully install SMARTLearningSuite.msi.

In the examples below, the SMARTLearningSuite.msi file, supporting language .mst files and support folder are in the "C:\Work\Chained MSI\" folder.


-----


SMART Install Manager:

To use a transform generated by SMART Install Manager, use the following command line:

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" TRANSFORMS="{full path to location of transform .mst}\SMARTProducts.mst" /qn


To apply multiple transforms to the SMARTLearningSuite.msi (for example, to apply the German language .mst), use the following command line: 

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" TRANSFORMS=SMARTProducts.mst;1031.mst /qn

--------------


SMART Product properties:

The following are examples of deploying SMART Education Software products using the command line and supported product properties. A list of all acceptable supported properties is located at the end of this file.
Also, for a more comprehensive and up-to-date description of all properties and administrative information, refer to the SMART Education Software System Admin Guide.

By design the following products are installed by default:
SMART Notebook, SMART Product Drivers, SMART Ink, Gallery Essentials, and Lesson Activity Toolkit.

So just by running the following command line all these products will be installed:
msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" /qn

NOTE: If you have previous product versions already installed then the installation will perform upgrades on these products. If there are any products that are no longer requires or needed then
set those product properties to "" and supply UNINSTALL_EXISTING=1 on the command line to have those products removed. Examples of these commands are also below.

-----

1. Deploy only SMART Notebook, SMART Product Drivers, and SMART Notebook Math Tools to a custom folder (<custom folder> is the complete path to the folder bounded by quotes, such as "C:\SMART Software") :

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" ENABLE_MATH_TRIAL=1 INSTALL_INK="" FULL_GALLERY="" LAT_CONTENT="" INSTALLDIR=<custom folder> /qn

-----

2. Deploy only SMART Notebook with Spanish and French handwriting resources. In addition, turn off desktop icons (desktop icons are on by default):

-----

3. Deploy only SMART Notebook and SMART Product Drivers with SMART Product Update (SPU) option set to Dashboard mode and Customer Experience Program option disabled:

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" INSTALL_INK="" FULL_GALLERY="" LAT_CONTENT="" INSTALL_SPU=2 CUSTOMER_LOGGING=0 /qn

-----

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" INSTALL_NOTEBOOK=1 INSTALL_BOARD=1 INSTALL_INK="" FULL_GALLERY="" LAT_CONTENT="" SPU_TIME_FRAME=10 /qn

-----

6. Deploy All products, but set SPU notifications to disabled, so users are not notifed when updates are available.

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" PRODUCT_NOTIFICATION=0 /qn

-----

7. Install/deploy SMART Notebook, with Notebook activation key, SMART Product Drivers, and Gallery Essentials. Also enable the Customer Experience Program, turn off SMART Print Capture and SMART Document Camera drivers. 

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" NB_PROD_KEY=0124789ASDFASDFK234234 ACTIVATE_LICENSE=1 INSTALL_INK="" LAT_CONTENT="" PRINT_CAPTURE="" INSTALL_DOCCAM_DRIVERS="" CUSTOMER_LOGGING=1 /qn

-----

8. Install and activate SMART Notebook, SMART Product Drivers, Gallery Essentials and Lesson Activity Toolkit. Specify Team Content and My Content folders:

-----

10. Like option 9 (above) but doesn't enable Tablet PC support or start SMART Board Tools when the user logs on:

msiexec /i "C:\Work\Chained MSI\SMARTLearningSuite.msi" INSTALL_BOARD=1 INSTALL_NOTEBOOK=1 NB_PROD_KEY=10483838WEFLKJDIF83KD3 ACTIVATE_LICENSE=1 FULL_GALLERY="" LAT_CONTENT="" INSTALL_UNSIGNED_DRIVERS=1 ENABLE_STPCS="" LAUNCH_SYSTEM_MENU="" /qb
